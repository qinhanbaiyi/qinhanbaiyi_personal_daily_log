2月14日是西方的情人节，中国也有关于爱情的节日，那就是七タ节。关于七タ节有一个牛郎与织女的神话传说，据说这对恋人被分隔在银河两岸，每年七月初七，一群喜鹊会搭成鹊桥以使这对恋人相见。与西方的情人节不同，中国情人节并不强调送玫瑰花和巧克力。

February 14th is Valentine’s Day in western countries. China also has the Qixi Festival, which is symbolic of love. About Qixi Festival, there is a `theological story` that a couple of lovers, who were split by `the Milky Way` and only meet through a bridge made by a group of birds on the seventh day of the seventh `lunar month`. The difference of St Valentine in the west is we don’t emphasize the importance of roses and chocolates in the Chinese Qixi Festival.

February 14th is St. Valentine's Day in western countries. China also has a day about love- Qixi Festival. About this festival, there is a mythology of Niu Lang and Zhi Nv, which says that the couple was banished to `the opposite sides of` the Milky Way. Once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh `lunar month`, `a flock of magpies` would form a bridge to reunite the lovers. Unlike St Valentines Day in the West, there is not so much emphasis on giving roses and chocolates.
`a flock of magpies`; magpy 喜鹊
